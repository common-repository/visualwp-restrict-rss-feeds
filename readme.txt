A quick and easy solution to automatically disable all RSS feeds or restrict rss access with a custom password. 

== Description ==
The Restrict RSS Feeds plugin gives you several useful options for managing your feed such as:

1. Switching off all RSS feeds in your WordPress installation
2. Restricting access to authorized users by requiring a password for access
3. Removing descriptions and excerpts from the feed
4. Removing author names from the feed

RSS is a type of web feed that allows your readers to automatically get new content in email newsletters and RSS feed readers.

RSS feeds can be useful for your website when running a blog but are unnecessary if using WordPress as a basic website builder or ecommerce site. Some blog posts may also be gated content and be intended to be visible by authorized users only.
